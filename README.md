# Easy Notes

  An android mobile application that allows a user to take notes and save them to view the notes for each day. The user is also able to edit/delete notes if needed.

  The application is build with Node.js, React-Native, and React-Redux. The persistency of the notes are enabled through a running website (easy_notes.herokuapp.com) that I have deployed to fetch data and write to the database easy_notes.herokuapp.com. This deployed web application is runninng on Express server with a NoSQL database MongoDB as the database.
